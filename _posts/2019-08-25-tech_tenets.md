1. **Over time, fewer and fewer engineers should be required to accomplish more and more complex engineering tasks.**

2. **Business Rules and configurations shall not be encoded in software procedures**. Instead, they will be expressed declaratively outside the code so that changes can be made quickly.

3. **Adopt the functional programming style, achieve at least 2X productivity**. Use Kotlin, not Java as it has a lot of unnecessary boilerplate code. Since Kotlin is fully JVM compatible, it is fully interoperable with existing Java libraries. 

4. **Apply machine learning** to generate actionable business insights. **Adopt visualization techniques over verbose reports.**

5. **Anything that we build should be simple and intuitive with frictionless UX**.
