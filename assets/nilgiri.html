		    The gaur (Bos gaurus), or Indian bison, is the world’s largest wild cattle species is very common in the Nilgiris. With a dark coat, white leg markings, and massive curved horns, adult males can weigh over a ton and stand up to 2.2 meters tall with horns spanning 1.2 meters. Primarily herbivores that feed on grasses, shoots, and fruits, gaurs are usually shy but can be very aggressive if threatened. They are active during the day, especially in the early morning and late afternoon when they graze. In areas with frequent human disturbance, they often shift their activity to the night or late evening to avoid encounters. They have fairly good night vision, due to a reflective layer in their eyes called the tapetum lucidum, which helps them see better in low light. Their keen sense of smell allows them to detect predators even at a distance, and their acute hearing helps them stay alert in the dark. Gaurs depend on their size, strength, and herd behavior for protection.

These wasps are kleptoparasitic, meaning they lay their eggs in the nests of other solitary bees or wasps. When the cuckoo wasp larva hatches, it consumes the host’s eggs or larvae, as well as the provisions stored in the nest. Despite their striking appearance and aggressive reproductive strategy, cuckoo wasps are generally harmless to humans, rarely stinging unless provoked. Their behavior and vivid exoskeleton make them a remarkable example of nature’s diversity and evolutionary ingenuity. patches below its eyes.
